# Space Rockets Challenge. Pleo Frontend Challenge

In this document I will describe all the procedures before developing any code and also how the code was written with Pull Requests and testing each of the features.

# Demo

You can find a demo in the following Netlify hosted site

# How did I work on this challenge?

Before writting any code I read through the description of the task. I treated each of the requirements as tickets, thus there is a **Pull request** associated to each of the tasks in the challenge.

Every "small feature" was developed in a separated pull request with the commits associated to it. This is a common practice I follow, afterwards someone reviews my PR or do a Pair Programming exercise to ensure the quality and coding standards of the feature being developed.

- Fixing datetime bug
- Implementing sidebar favorite feature
- Implementing a Rocket Animation in the home screen
- Refactoring some components

## Who reviewed my PR's ?

My friend's dog was in charge with the mission of reviewing my PRs in exchange for treats.

## What did I learn?

I have never used the SpaceX api before it is actually a really well built API and I loved working with it.

Along with this, I had the opportunity to make a css animation, it's been a while since I was able to build one of this from scratch :)

It was a fun challenge as I am passionate of space! Have you watched Luna short film on youtube?

## What can be improved?

Many things may be improved in this code, here I am shortlisting a few:

- Adding a test suite
- Refactoring the application even more, I have noticed we are not using Typescript yet.
- Refactoring some of the React Components, we are not using jsx
- Many more
